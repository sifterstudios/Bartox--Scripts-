# Bartox Game (Scripts)

This repo shows the scripts folder of my solo game 'Bartox', which is in active development in my free time and set to release [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081300/Bartox/) Late 2023.

Bartox is a linear 3D puzzler about Bart, a magical violin that teleports him to another world, and about how our world and that magical world affects each other. With a heavy focus on narration and audio I hope to learn enough to start working in GameDev full time through this project.
